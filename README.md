Hi, 

these are my personal lecture notes. 

You are welcome to use them. I cannot guarantee any correctness of the notes nor that i will continue this for the whole lecture. Typically i update the notes fridays or saturdays after the lecture.


You can always find the latest version of the PDF in the sidebar to the right.
