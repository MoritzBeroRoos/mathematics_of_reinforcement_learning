Hi, 

these are my personal lecture notes. 

You are free to use them as long as you credit me. You are free to modify them, as long as you also mark them as modified (i dont want stuff i didn't write to appear as fully written by me).


You can always find the latest version of the PDF in the sidebar to the right.
